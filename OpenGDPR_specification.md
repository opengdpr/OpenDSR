# OpenGDPR

An open specification for data subject request management.

### Version 1.0

### Abstract

This document defines a common specification for Data Controllers and Processors to
build interoperable systems for tracking and honoring Data Subject Rights requests
to support the accountability principle as defined under the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR).

It defines roles, responsibilities, objects and protocols that Data Controllers
and Processors can utilize to distribute, fulfill and report the status of a range
of Data Subject request types.

For more information on the Data Subject Rights, [see chapter 3 of the GDPR
legislation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN).

## 1. Introduction

This specification is intended to:
- Provide a well defined JSON specification that allows Controllers and Processors to communicate and
manage Data Subject access, portability and erasure requests in a uniform and scalable
manner.
- Provide strong cryptographic verification of request receipts to provide chain of
processing assurance and demonstrate accountability to regulatory authorities (Article
5.2).
- Provide for a callback mechanism to enable Controllers to identify the status of
all Data Subject requests.

This specification does not cover:

- Defining the technical measures to describe the fulfill of Data Subject requests.
It is the responsibility of each Data Controller and Data Processor to interpret and
apply the GDPR to honor Data Subject requests (Chapter 3).
- The protocol for communications between Controllers and Data Subjects.
- The protocol for communications between Controllers or Processors and Supervisory
Authorities.
- The protocol for communication of the results of an access or portability request.

### 1.1.  Notational Conventions
- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
- Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) **MUST** be lowercase and v4 format.


## 2. Terms and Definitions

#### Data Subject Request

A request from a Data Subject exercising their Data Subject Rights as defined within the GDPR under Chapter 3.

#### Fulfillment

Enacting compliance related activities to honor an OpenGDPR request.

## 3. OpenGDPR Basics

### 3.1. Roles and Responsibilities

#### Data Subject

  A European Union resident whose personal data is being processed.

#### Data Controller

  An entity which makes the decision about what personal data  will be processed and the types of processing that will be done with respect to that personal data. The Data Controller receives Data Subject requests from the Data Subjects and validates them. The Data Controller **SHOULD** provide a callback endpoint. The Data Controller **SHOULD** verify response signatures. Referenced as "Controller."

#### Data Processor

  The organization that processes data pursuant to the instructions of the Controller on behalf of the Controller. The Data Processor receives data subject requests via RESTful endpoints and is responsible for fulfilling requests. The Data Processor **MUST** provide a signed response to requests. The Data Processor **MUST** honor callbacks.  Data Processors **MUST** honor callbacks included in requests.

  Processors **MUST** provide the following endpoints:

  - `/discovery`
  - `/status`
  - `/opengdpr_requests`

### 3.2.  Protocol Flow

![protocol flow](images/figure_protocol_flow.png)

*Figure 1. Request Sequence Flow*

The flow illustrated in figure 1 includes the following steps:

1. A new data subject request submitted to the Controller
2. Controller verifies the request and submits it to Processors
3. Processor fulfills request
4. Processor reports status to the Controller via callbacks
5. Controller reports back to the Data Subject

### 3.3.  Transport

Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this specification, the appropriate version (or versions) of TLS will vary over time, based on the
widespread deployment and known security vulnerabilities. Implementations **MAY** also support additional transport layer security mechanisms that meet an individual partyâ€™s (e.g. Controller or Processor) security requirements.

### 3.4. Versions
This spec will be released by major and minor increments using semantic versioning. Breaking changes will be pushed in major branches. More info is available here: https://semver.org/.

URLs **MUST** include the major version number at the start, for example: https://opengdpr.processor.com/v1/discovery.

Resources **MAY** include the major and minor version in the "api_version" field, examples shown below.

## 4. Security

### 4.1. Certificates

Digital certificates used in this protocol **MUST** be issued by a trusted
certificate authority and **MUST** be issued to the organization issuing the
callback. A self-signed certificate **MUST NOT** be used.

### 4.2. Signing

Digital signatures **MUST** be generated and validated according to the Digital
Signature Standard FIPS PUB 186-4: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf

### 4.3.  Authentication

API authentication for OpenGDPR requests is out of scope for this document, and is left to the Processor to implement. Callbacks **MUST** be authenticated by a digital signature issued by the certificate detailed in section 4.1.

## 5. Identities

The identity types and schema documented below are reused throughout all OpenGDPR API contracts.

### 5.1.  Identity Type Keys

The following identity type keys are supported:

```
controller_customer_id
android_advertising_id
android_id
email
fire_advertising_id
ios_advertising_id
ios_vendor_id
microsoft_advertising_id
microsoft_publisher_id
roku_publisher_id
roku_advertising_id
```

### 5.2 Identity Formats

The following identity formats are supported:

```
raw
sha1
md5
sha256
```

### 5.3. Identity Object

An OpenGDPR request **MUST** contain one or more Identity objects used to fulfill
the request. An Identity object contains the following properties:

- `identity_type`

  **REQUIRED** string value representing the form of identity. Supported values: See section 5.1.

- `identity_value`

  **REQUIRED** string value representing the identity. This does not apply to discovery response objects.

- `identity_format`

  **REQUIRED** string value representing the encoding of the identity. Supported values: See section 5.2.

## 6. OpenGDPR Discovery

### 8.8. Callback Authentication

In order to authenticate a callback, a Party **SHOULD** perform the following actions:
1. Read the X-OpenGDPR-Processor-Domain request header.
2. Fetch the public key from a cache based on identity.
3. If not present in cache, make a call to /discovery of the caller and cache the public key.  The Party performing authentication **MAY** whitelist allowed
endpoints.
4. Validate that the signature in the X-OpenGDPR-Signature header is valid for the body of the request.  The Party **SHOULD** NOT parse the payload until the signature
has been validated, but rather pass the raw contents into the signature validation function.
5. Return 403 if validation fails.
6. Verify the status_callback_url matches the Party's own endpoint. Return if this check fails.

## 9.  Cancellation Endpoint
OpenGDPR endpoints **MUST** accept request cancellations via an HTTP DELETE for the subject_request_id. OpenGDPR requests **MAY** be cancelled by the Controller while in status "pending".

### 9.1.  Example Cancellation Request

```http
DELETE /opengdpr_requests/a7551968-d5d6-44b2-9831-815ac9017798 HTTP/1.1
Host: example-processor.com
Accept: application/json
```

### 9.2.  Cancellation Response Properties
For well formed requests, the OpenGDPR service **MUST** respond with HTTP status
code 202, and the following parameters:

`controller_id`

  **REQUIRED** string indicating the unique identity of the Controller in the
  Processor's system.

`received_time`

  **REQUIRED** RFC 3339 date string representing the time when the Processor received the cancellation request.

`subject_request_id`

  **REQUIRED** UUID v4 string from the originating OpenGDPR request.

`processor_signature`

  **REQUIRED** Base64 encoded signature of the SHA 256 digest of the body of the
  response.

## 10.   Best Practices

All Parties **MUST** make best efforts to not throttle during normal operation.

Controllers **MAY** use a sub-processor to manage their OpenGDPR request infrastructure
to ensure requests are distributed reliably, security signatures are verified and
thorough logs are kept.

## 11.   Security Considerations

The intention of this specification is to improve data subject privacy by making it
easier to fulfill their GDPR rights. In doing so, there is a risk to leaking data
subject identities. Implementers are encouraged to take reasonable measures to
